                Every Hindu God or Goddess has a dedicated day when they are venerated. One of the reasons why the Goddess of Wisdom is worshipped is because it is believed that she was born on this day.  Devotees perform pujas, offer her prasad and wear the colour yellow to mark the flowering of mustard fields. It is believed that yellow is Goddess Saraswati favourite colour.

                Mostly in the Bihari community, a traditional ceremony is held where children and babies are motivated to pen their first words, thus taking a step into the world of arts, culture and literature. Cultural programmes also take place where people perform songs and dance. Most educational institutions remain closed on this day.
